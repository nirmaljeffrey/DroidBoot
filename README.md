# DroidBoot
DroidBoot makes it easy to production grade Android Jetpack based applications that you can "just run".

 
 ## WHY DROIDBOOT?
   *  Why the features in android are taking more time for development?
   *  Why there is no documentation for features developed in android and implementation for each screen varies from dev to dev?
   *  Why devs are spending more time on bug fixes?
   *  Why code is not unit testable?
   *  Why developers are not able to concentrate on user experience (eg: layout designs, animations)?
   *  Why dependency injection is not used?
   *  Why process death was not handled in most of the places in our existing applications?
  
     
  #### We are proposing droidboot as solution for all the above questions.  DroidBoot is a library/module which will be built on top of android jetpack components and, it will help to reduce bugs and development time spent on an Android feature. More importantly, it will make developers avoid reinventing the wheel while developing a feature. DroidBoot will be at the intersection of MVVM and MVI architecture.DroidBoot will expose APIs at the view layer, ViewModel layer, Repository layer to prevent developers from performing mundane tasks while developing an android feature.
